lci reported a mixed fq as revenues came in short of consensus while an eps
beat was driven by lower tax we expect shares to be weak tomorrow as downward
revisions to lci sales guidance but more importantly to its gross margin guidance
came as a negative surprise to investors with the midpoint of gross margin guidance
implying fq q margins in the mid s we expect investors to wonder whether
or not this is the new norm and if out year estimates should adjust accordingly while
we have a favorable view of management strategy to diversify its revenue base
overall we still remain cautious on the stock as we think management has to better
address the potential impact of new generic levothyroxine entrants in cy
key points
guidance at the midpoint lci lowered its sales guidance by  but lowered
its gross margin guidance by bps while the majority of the gross margin
revision was due to less levo sales as sandoz is likely to return to the market
sooner than expected some is also from the launch of partnered products ie
toprol xl which have lower gross margins
new products delays launching its recently approved products until fq plus
less levo contribution means we will not see improving gross margins this year and
should see a meaningful step down sequentially we remain cautious about the
ability of lci pipeline to deliver significant growth though think management
strategy to invest in more partnerships licensing opportunities to diversify its
revenue base seems prudent
balance sheet debt reduction and refinancing remains a priority for the company
we estimate lci net debt leverage at x though we think this could rise to
x in f in the case of multiple levo generic approvals interest expense
will increase in cy due to lci debt terms so a potential refinancing could
be a positive near term catalyst for shares
levothyroxine with levo expected to make up  of our  ebitda
estimate we believe there remains meaningful concentration risk as noted in
our recent report if  new levo generics are approved we could see pricing fall
significantly and think offsetting factors like lower tax and potential numbrino sales
may not be enough to make up the lost profits
model updates overall we lower our f  eps by   due to lower
gross margins we think out year gross margins in the mid  range probably
make sense now particularly if we see additional levo competition we lower our
sales forecast to reflect guidance of  m which accounts for upcoming
launches of recently approved products but not for any new approvals
while in the near term lci is likely to benefit from a competitor’s
disruption in the levothyroxine market the potential for tax
reform and debt refinancing we don’t think the medium to longterm
story for the stock has changed we still believe there is
meaningful concentration risk with levothyroxine and additional
generic competition does not seem to be appropriately factored
into consensus numbers further we believe lci’s modest
anda pipeline and launch of numbrino may not be sufficient to
fully offset the erosion
base case assumption
annual price volume erosion in line with the average rate within the
generic industry
material levothyroxine erosion starting in fy

methylphenidate sales remain modest due to increased competition

upside scenario
lci is able to grow market share for major products including
levothyroxine and digoxin
no new generic entrants for levothyroxine
fda does not withdraw lci anda for methylphenidate er
annual price volume erosion less than average within the generic
industry
m in new product launches annually between  and 
greater than expected synergies from the ku acquisition
tax reform and lci benefits from lower tax rate
debt refinancing
downside scenario
new competitors enters the levothyroxine market
annual price volume erosion greater than average within the generic
industry
slow pace of anda approvals and or launches of products in highly
competitive markets
doj investigation warrants a large penalty
