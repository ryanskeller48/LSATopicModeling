this morning urgn reported q financial results and provided a business
update we adjust our model accordingly we believe interim study results from
mitogel olympus study in upper tract urothelial carcinoma utuc expected to be
presented at an upcoming medical conference will serve as a meaningful near term
catalyst for the shares should interim data and subsequent full top line data from the
olympus study be positive we think the shares could reach the low s based
on our revised cost of therapy assumptions we continue to see multiple avenues for
value creation in the next   months and raise our pt to  from 
key points
mitogel management did not disclose the medical meeting where the interim
results from olympus will be presented since full top line data from olympus
are expected in q our best guess would be the american urological
association aua meeting in may with that said we believe interim data
demonstrating a cr  in the intent to treat itt population will be received
positively by investors
vesigel urgn intends to file an ind for vesigel in q and plans to initiate a
phase  single arm open label study for vesigel in non muscle invasive bladder
cancer nmibc soon thereafter the company plans to enroll   patients
considered to have high recurrence nmibc meaning they typically require 
turbt procedures per year data from this study are expected in 
rtgel we believe partnering the rtgel platform remains a key value creation
avenue which should not be overlooked by investors given rtgel ability to 
be delivered into difficult to reach anatomies;  increase drug dwell time improve
efficacy; and  be formulated with small molecules ie mitomycin c and large
molecules ie botox we think this should lead to future partnership opportunities
balance sheet including cash from its january equity offering we estimate
urgn has pro forma cash of m plenty of cash to achieve near term
clinical milestones but also for potential business development to bring additional
development stage assets into the fold we think urgn will be opportunistic on
potential asset acquisitions and will not stray too far from its core competency in
uro oncology urology
valuation we are raising our price target to  based on an updated cost
of therapy assumption for mitogel based on our discussion with management
recent pricing research it has conducted suggests a mitogel cost of therapy of
upwards of k was still viewed positively by payers therefore we modestly
adjust our assumption upward to k from k previously
we believe urgn’s proprietary rtgel platform may allow for
improved drug delivery and efficacy in various types of urothelial
cancers given its ability to be delivered in hard to treat areas
within the urinary tract without interfering with the natural flow of
fluids from the urinary tract and bladder we view the platform
as somewhat de risked given encouraging data from urgn’s
early studies for both mitogel and vesigel in their respective
indications and believe they could represent a paradigm shift in
the treatment of uro oncology indications if approved
base case assumption
urgn reports positive results from mitogel pivotal study and is
approved for low grade utuc in h pos 
mitogel achieves un risk adjusted peak sales of m before
patent expiry in 
vesigel receives approval for low grade nmibc in  and
achieves un risk adjusted peak sales of m before patent expiry
in 
modest risk adjusted pipeline value  share for vesimune and
botugel
catalysts
 mitogel pivotal trial interim data
q full top line results from mitogel pivotal study in low grade
utuc
q nda filing for mitogel for low grade utuc
h approval for mitogel for low grade utuc
 data readout of vesigel phase b trial
upside scenario
mitogel achieves un risk adjusted peak sales of m and or its
patent runway is extended beyond  for low grade utuc
vesigel achieves un risk adjusted peak sales of m and or its
patent runway is extended beyond patent expiry in 
vesimune receives approval and is coercialized for high grade
nmibc
agn receives approval for botugel for overactive bladder syndrome
and interstitial cystitis
downside scenario
urgn rtgel platform causes safety issues leading to failure of
both mitogel and vesigel programs
mitogel fails to demonstrate efficacy in its pivotal study
mitogel fails to achieve un risk adjusted peak sales of m and or
its patent expires before  for low grade utuc
urgn is not successful in the clinical development of vesigel
vesigel fails to achieve un risk adjusted peak sales of m and 
or its patent expires before 
urgn pipeline asset vesimune and partnered asset botugel fail
in clinical development
