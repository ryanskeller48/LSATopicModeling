endp reported a q top  and bottom line beat; however  guidance came in
below expectations the company remains in the midst of a multi year turnaround
and like its generic peers has been focusing on profitability through pruning products
and simplifying its manufacturing footprint while the company has made some
strides we remain cautious on shares given endp high debt modest cash flow
generation for debt repayment and lack of meaningful growth drivers while shares
look cheap trading at x our e ebitda we prefer to stay on the sidelines
until we see more material signs of stabilization growth debt paydown
key points
guidance  revenue eps guidance came in  and  below
consensus midpoint respectively the majority of the year over year shortfall
on the top line is coming from its established brands due to opana er removal 
competition to other legacy brands and its us generic segment due to erosion
and a tough  comp zetia seroquel first to files guidance also suggests
negative cash flow before debt repayment
us generics endp is guiding to a high  decline for its us generics
business built into its forecast is the impact of the first to files from 
discontinuation of generic products of  m and potential competitive
events we think recent portfolio pruning should lead to enhanced profitability over
time though management seemed to remain cautious overall on further potential
pressure from consortiums
xiaflex for cellulite endp remains enthusiastic about the opportunity for xiaflex
in cellulite the company recently started its two pivotal studies which are
expected to report top line results in q while this program remains interesting
we remain cautious as it is unclear how attractive xiaflex pricing would be in this
setting if price is not bifurcated for aesthetic and medical indications
vasostrict with m in  revenues vasostrict remains a key product we
est  of our e ebitda in endp portfolio most important is endp
current litigation with the fda regarding compounders and whether they should
be allowed to manufacture this product since endp has an approved drug and
ip an update is expected from the fda in march
valuation based on our revised  ebitda estimate of b endp
currently trades at x ev ebitda that is below the group trading at  x
which we think is fair given its modest operating cash flow generation high
leverage we estimate leverage of x net debt e ebitda and modest
growth prospects in the near to medium term
we maintain our perform rating as we believe endp remains
in the early innings of a turnaround we believe the challenges
facing its generics business will continue to be a headwind
into  and endp strategy to shift into alternative generic
dosage forms will take time to play out we are positive on
management strategy longer term but believe endp is likely to
be range bound pending  meaningful de levering of its balance
sheet;  stabilization of the company base generics business;
and  meaningful new launches from both its generic and b
portfolios
base case assumption
base generics business declines in the high  range
xiaflex remains approved only for dupuytren and peyronie
disease
modest operating expense growth between  and 
catalysts
 divestment of certain legacy brands and or international
business
 testosterone and lidoderm litigation updates
march  fda update on vasostrict compounding
q phase  xiaflex for cellulite top line data
upside scenario
base generics business price market share erosion begins to
stabilize
xiaflex growth in dupuytren and peyronie exceeds our street
forecasts
xiaflex phase  results in cellulite are positive and receives approval
for the indication
downside scenario
base generics business price market share erosion is greater than
expected
xiaflex growth slows to mid single digits faster than expected
endp cash flow is not sufficient to de lever balance sheet in a
timely fashion
fda allows bulk compounding of vasostrict
testosterone and lidoderm litigation settlement costs are greater
than expected
