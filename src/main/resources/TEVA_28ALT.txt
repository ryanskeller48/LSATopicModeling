as we noted in our eps preview we suspected consensus  sales eps ebitda
estimates were too high and were cautious into the print for a highly levered company
facing meaningful headwinds to both its branded and us generic segments along
with execution risk around a multi year restructuring plan we don't think the shares
are particularly cheap teva trades at x our revised e ebitda of b
well ahead of its best comparable myl at x further we think a potential
delay in approval for what is hailed as one of the company few growth drivers
fremanezumab along with categorical pricing pressures in generics present risk
we prefer to remain on the sidelines until we see more material progress on teva
restructuring initiatives
key points
guidance  ebitda guidance of  b fell well short of consensus'
b estimate with that said teva new ceo is likely taking a more
conservative approach on guidance given the company inconsistency over the
last   months we think teva ability to balance massive cost cuts without
impairing future growth drivers ie austedo fremanezumab remains on the
minds of investors
copaxone of teva total b revenue decline from  to  
is coming from expected competition to copaxone it expects global copaxone
sales of b vs the street b forecast which accounts for a second
us generic mg likely mnta sandoz entering the market as soon as q
we believe this will put continued pressure on company gross margins eps
throughout 
us generics teva expects us generic revenues of b in  vs the street
b view management was less transparent on the call re estimated generic
pricing erosion new potential product launches or portfolio optimization specifics
for  though we know additional competition for teva g concerta est'd 
 m product in  will be a key headwind here
fremanezumab as if teva investors didn't have enough to worry about a
potential approval delay of its anti cgrp for episodic and chronic migraine would
be an unwelcome event it is unclear whether or not celltrion warning letter will
impact the timing of fremanezumab potential june  approval but think a
negative update presents further headline risk for the shares
balance sheet teva remains highly levered and we estimate by the end of
 a net debt leverage ratio of approximately x range given our revised
e ebitda while management highlighted the potential for additional small
divestitures for further debt paydown and refinancing near term maturities we
don't see the balance sheet improving drastically any time soon
we no longer see a clear path for teva to return to growth in
a timely manner and continued pricing pressure in us generics
makes us less optimistic its us generic business will meet 
exceed street expectations in fy we do not view teva as
a growth story in the near to medium term and continued focus
on cost cutting divestments is required to ensure it meets its debt
obligations
base case assumption
two copaxone mg generics and teva launches an authorized
generic
fremanezumab is approved for migraine
industry average price erosion for us generics base business
management does not disclose erosion rate
catalysts
 potential launch of ab rated epipen
 agn to sell teva stake
 debt refinancing
q mnta sandoz launches copaxone competitor
june   fremanezumab pdufa
upside scenario
one copaxone mg generic is on market in  and teva
launches an authorized generic
austedo receives approval for tourette syndrome
other less visible pipeline programs receive approvals and generate
meaningful sales
accretive m&a
less than industry average price erosion for us generics base
business
downside scenario
 copaxone mg generics are approved and teva does not
launch an authorized generic
fremanezumab fails to gain regulatory approval for migraine
fremanezumab is not approved or launched in a timely fashion
greater than industry average price erosion for us generics base
business
greater copaxone price and share erosion than expected
