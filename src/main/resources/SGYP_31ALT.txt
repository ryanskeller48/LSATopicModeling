sgyp reported q trulance sales of m which came in ahead of the consensus
m estimate we update our model accordingly the company did not provide 
revenue guidance  covenant requires min trulance sales of m though
did provide operating expense guidance of  m which was m below
consensus we still remain cautious on shares as the newly amended debt agreement
reduces the total amount of capital available to the company by m though
does provide more flexibility around the minimum market cap requirement for the
next m based on our consensus trulance sales forecasts for   we
believe sgyp will still require an additional  m in capital in order to reach
breakeven we prefer to remain on the sidelines until an inflection in trulance sales
and maintain our perform rating
key points
trulance of the m in trulance revenue m came from previously deferred
revenue meaning volume sales were really m we continue to wait for the
inflection in trulance sales and think its improved formulary access in  along
with the approval of the ibs c indication should help we now forecast 
trulance sales of m vs consensus of m
operating expenses the majority of the   year over year cost reduction
excl stock comp from  to  is due to much lower r&d expense as sgyp
has shifted to a coercial company with that said management believes it
could potentially achieve further cost efficiencies in  we forecast operating
expense of m in  slightly below the mid point of guidance
crg deal amendment the amendment to the crg deal provides more flexibility
for sgyp to access the next three tranches in  m cumulative but
takes off the table the additional m we believe the company needs to reach
profitability while sgyp continues to seek alternative avenues of non dilutive
financing such as partnerships we still think there remains risk of future dilution
balance sheet sgyp ended q with m in cash assuming it secures the
additional m from the crg agreement in  and meets consensus sales
forecasts between  and  we forecast it has a cash runway until 
meaning the company would likely require access to additional capital sometime
in  based on our math
business development while we have a positive view of the company recent
trulance licensing deal with cph for canada the m upfront fee to sgyp isn't
going to move the needle further the branded constipation market is small with
roughly m in branded sales according to the company so potential trulance
royalty revenue from canada would likely be modest at best
while we continue to believe sgypâ€™s plecanatide for the
treatment of chronic constipation offers a differentiated profile
and improved tolerability relative to the incumbent branded
therapies we see potential dilutive financing in  as sgyp
may not be able to qualify for the third and fourth tranches of
cash from its crg deal because of the capital and dilution risk
overhang we expect shares to remain range bound in the near
term
base case assumption
plecanatide achieves our m peak sales target by 
modest value  share for sgyp second development program
dolcanatide a potential treatment for ulcerative colitis
catalysts
 sgyp potentially acquired
 potential business development partnerships
upside scenario
plecanatide exceeds our m peak sales target by 
sgyp is acquired
sgyp does not finance with equity
downside scenario
plecanatide falls short of our m peak sales target by 
sgyp requires multiple dilutive financings to reach profitability
competition from new pipeline agents
