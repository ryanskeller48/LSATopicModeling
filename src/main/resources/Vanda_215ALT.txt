since vnda pre announced its q financial results on jan th  there were
really no surprises in yesterdayâ€™s update we continue to like the set up for the
stock over the next  months as we expect hetlioz sales acceleration due to the
company hetlioz for psychiatrists initiative hpi based on our previous deep dive on
the sighted non  opportunity and key data readouts for tradipitant for gastroparesis
and hetlioz for smith magenis syndrome sms however we get the sense investors
may be taking a wait and see approach regarding the opportunity for hetlioz in sighted
non  and may wait for more tangible evidence of sales volume growth before
stepping into the shares our pt moves to  from ; reiterate outperform
key points
hetlioz based on our follow up call with management we remain encouraged
about hpi as fanapt sales have begun to get some traction though recall that
script fulfillment rates are much lower only  or so in this population vs blind
non  patients we believe as vnda begins to better navigate reimbursement
hurdles for sighted patients we could see an inflection in sales
fanapt fanapt growth still is not core to our thesis even if vnda realizes only
half of its recent  price increase on fanapt the midpoint of  fanapt
guidance implies little to no volume growth we see a return to volume growth as
upside and think that if fanapt sales at a minimum offset the cost of the sales
force for hpi it a win
jet lag study results from its pivotal study are expected in the coming weeks
but vnda awaits the data before providing timing of a potential snda filing to
the street that said we give vnda no value for jls given the coercial
challenges in pricing hetlioz cost would be nearly  for  day treatment
high for a consumer health product
atopic dermatitis ad vnda remains on track to have an end of phase 
meeting with the fda in order to receive feedback on the design of tradipitant
phase  study in ad we believe clarity around study design in h and results
from competitor mnlo serlopitant phase  study in ad expected in q same
moa as tradipitant both serve as near term catalysts
valuation our pt moves to  based on a lower out year tax rate to 
from  we estimate vnda base business hetlioz for non  fanapt
for schizophrenia is worth  share for the pipeline we assign  share
 share and  share for hetlioz for sms tradipitant for gastroparesis and
tradipitant for atopic dermatitis respectively
we believe vanda pharmaceuticals offers investors a growing
base business with hetlioz non  and fanapt schizophrenia
along with significant pipeline optionality we expect vnda
to report data from what we believe are two relatively derisked
clinical studies in the next  months investors may
be overlooking vnda clinical programs as we believe
today valuation reflects only the company coercial assets
for its base business  guidance looks achievable and
management re launch strategy for fanapt could yield modest
growth for the franchise
