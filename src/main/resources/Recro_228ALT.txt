this morning we attended reph analyst day where management and key opinion
leaders kols highlighted iv meloxicam prevention of post operative pain clinical
data the company go to market strategy and also provided some color on its cdmo
business overall we maintain our conviction on the market opportunity for reph
iv meloxicam and believe the current share price does not adequately reflect this
product potential value given the totality of the product data and profile borne
out in clinical studies we believe iv meloxicam will become an important part of
multimodal regimens focused on preventing post operative pain and reducing opioid
usage we continue to like the set up in the near term and the stock remains one of
our favorite small cap ideas reiterate outperform
key points
iv meloxicam we believe iv meloxicam is approvable based on its positive
phase  studies and are also interested in the outcomes of reph phase b
studies ye  in colorectal surgery and total knee replacement since it will be
administered pre operatively we believe improvements on los opioid reduction
and hc utilization in these studies will further bolster its value proposition
coercialization strategy assuming approval on its may   pdufa
the company plans to initially launch iv meloxicam with  reps expanding to
 reps six months later targeting physicians in settings with fewer barriers
to adoption such as ascs and hospital outpatient settings we think this makes
sense as physicians in these settings are intensely focused on ambulating patients
faster reducing opioids
kol feedback consistent with our recent physician checks kols highlighted
the need for new non opioid analgesics and continued focus on a multimodal
approach to post operative pain management particularly through eras
protocols both physicians discussed the need to reduce opioids post operatively
viewing iv meloxicam as part of the solution and liked its less frequent dosing
profile and potential use in elderly renal impaired patients
cdmo business while the analyst event largely focused on iv meloxicam
management did provide some color on the state of the cdmo business we
sense management  revenue guidance of m is likely conservative
and believe recent capital equipment investments ie tablet press coating
capabilities and business development hires could yield additional revenues from
both new and existing coercial partners
valuation we value reph shares at  using a sum of the parts valuation
analysis we estimate the cdmo business alone is worth  share using an
x multiple on our e ebitda and iv meloxicam is worth  share using
an npv analysis between   with no terminal value
our thesis is predicated on  reph’s cdmo business is
currently worth the entire stock price today we estimate the
value for this business at  share meaning investors are not
giving reph any credit for its potentially soon to be approved
iv meloxicam moderate to severe pain after surgery;  in our
view reph’s iv meloxicam is approvable and its upcoming
pdufa date represents a low risk free call option for investors
at the current stock price; and  we remain positive on the nonopioid
analgesic category as a whole and believe reph fits well
into this theme
