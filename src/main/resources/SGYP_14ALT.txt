while we continue to believe synergy trulance constipation is differentiated and
will gain traction in the market we are downgrading the shares to perform from
outperform we see the potential for additional dilutive financing in  as sgyp
may not be able to qualify for the third and fourth tranches of funding from the crg
deal as we saw with the most recent financing required to qualify for the second
tranche we believe any additional equity offerings may require a meaningful discount
to the current stock price further we don't believe management cost reduction
program counicated on the q call will yield enough savings to eliminate the
need for an additional raise; hence we turn cautious on shares
key points
debt covenants as discussed on p  we believe the borrowing milestones ie
market cap thresholds required to access the third and fourth tranches m
each may prove difficult to meet we forecast an additional m equity raise
in order for sgyp to reach break even in  vs management ye target
and believe dilution risk will remain an overhang in the near term
costs we expect new ceo troy hamilton to provide more details on the costsavings
program first shared on the q call in march however since sgyp
is still in the early innings of a launch we expect savings to largely come from
g&a optimization vs s&m reduction and is unlikely to generate material savings
to stave off the need for capital
financing options while we could be wrong another equity raise seems most
logical either alone or potentially in conjunction with an acquisition to add another
product to sales reps' bag debt seems less likely given the terms of the crg
deal though there is always the possibility of renegotiation we view us licensing 
partnership royalty deals as less beneficial to equity holders
consensus estimates trulance scripts have been generally trending up week 
week in q and we expect sales to be in line with consensus' m estimate
that said  remains a crucial year for the launch and the company recent
success with payers will be very important in driving material sales acceleration
sgyp  minimum revenue covenant of m should be attainable
valuation based on our updated model which reflects the november  equity
raise sgyp currently trades at a calculated enterprise value of m fully
diluted includes options warrants and at x our e sales it is difficult for
us to advocate for a higher multiple and we believe the recently passed tax bill
may make sgyp less attractive for existing tax advantaged buyers
while we continue to believe sgypâ€™s plecanatide for the
treatment of chronic constipation offers a differentiated profile
and improved tolerability relative to the incumbent branded
therapies we see potential dilutive financing in  as sgyp
may not be able to qualify for the third and fourth tranches of
cash from its crg deal because of the capital and dilution risk
overhang we expect shares to remain range bound in the near
term

plecanatide achieves our m peak sales target by
