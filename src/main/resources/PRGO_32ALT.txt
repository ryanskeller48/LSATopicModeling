prgo issued  eps guidance bracketing consensus estimates which we think
should sit well with investors and could lead to a modest beat raise story throughout
 new ceo uvve roehrhoff started six weeks ago expects to share a more
comprehensive value creation plan with investors in the coming months specifically
plans around future capital deployment we think the recent  sell off on the
delayed eps report was unwarranted and believe prgo guidance under the ceo
may prove to be conservative as we think prgo has several levers to generate value
in the next   months ie capital deployment improving processes we would
be buyers of the stock at these levels and reiterate our outperform rating and  pt
we adjust our model accordingly
key points
chca in our view  sales guidance for the segment of  y y growth
on a cc basis negative impact due to loss of partnered product was a bit
underwhelming vs prgo historical   long term chca guidance though
industry trends continue to show store brand share gains vs national brands we
think chca low  operating margins should be repeatable in 
chci we continue to expect operating margin improvement toward the high
teens in the next couple of years as prgo insources more of its products
and further streamlines this business with that said increased operational
investments expected in  could limit upside potential more near term but
ultimately we believe the business is in much better shape than   months ago
rx pharma guidance implies  year over year growth for the rx segment
and includes launch of a risk adj g proair and an undisclosed partnered product
in q this segment remains decently resilient and we think prgo planned
investment in r&d is a prudent one to  of sales from   in order to
drive future organic growth and or to create a more valuable anda pipeline to
potentially sell the business down the road
capital deployment management intends to provide an update after it completes
its value creation roadmap on and capital deployment plans in the fall given
prgo flexible balance sheet we think a mix of bolt on m&a within consumer
health and share repo could be the likely priorities with  cfo guidance of 
m and current cash ofm if prgo repurchases only an amount similar
to  levels we estimate it could be worth an incremental   in eps
e coerce we continue to view amzn as another channel partner for the
company since prgo provides turn key store brand otc capabilities while the
online component of the otc market is small  share according to prgo
we think the company stands to benefit as the partner of choice within this growing
opportunity
we believe prgo offers investors  a highly defensible
store brand consumer healthcare business in the us where
prgo is the “ pound gorilla” with  market share; 
improving profitability in its chci business due to restructuring
and “accretive actions”; and  a niche rx pharma business
focused on harder to manufacture “extended topical” topical
products which typically face less competition we expect nice
operating margin and expansion during our forecast period and
a clean balance sheet gives prgo flexibility to return capital to
shareholders or to execute bolt on m&a to accelerate top line
