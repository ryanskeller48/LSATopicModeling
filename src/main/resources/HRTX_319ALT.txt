hrtx reported positive top line results from both its pivotal phase  studies for
htx  for the prevention of post op pain we believe today results reinforce
htx  superior profile relative to pcrx exparel pcrx weak on news and
believe its statistically significant opioid sparing ability vs generic bupivacaine will sit
well with p&t coittees and could drive faster uptake than exparel saw early in
launch investor focus likely will now turn to whether or not hrtx will ultimately launch
the product itself or be acquired we believe hrtx could fetch in the low s in a
takeout assuming prevailing ev s takeout multiples additionally hrtx reiterated it
does not expect to raise capital near term given its recent financing based on today
results we raise our price target to  from  and reiterate our outperform rating
key points
phase  results in both the bunion and hernia studies htx  was superior to
both pbo primary endpoint and generic bupivacaine on pain auc   htx 
also demonstrated a benign safety profile with lower ae rates than pbo and
generic bupivacaine we believe the results further validate htx  compelling
product profile relative to exparel which has not shown consistent superiority vs
generic bupivacaine hrtx plans to file its nda in h and given its fast track
designation could receive expedited review
opioid sparing htx  demonstrated superiority on both proportion of opioidfree
patients and overall opioid consumption vs pbo and generic bupivacaine
while unclear whether or not this data will ultimately make the product label if
approved we think hospital administrators physicians will view this data positively
as htx  will likely become an important part of opioid minimization strategies
administration the positive results also indicate htx  instillation
administration vs injection into tissue is effective our physician checks noted
this as a potential meaningful advantage as it would allow them to administer
local analgesia more quickly no need for numerous injections and would be less
technique dependent than exparel leading to more consistent efficacy
coercial management did not provide too much in terms of its htx 
coercial strategy but indicated  launch with a sales force size similar to
pcrx;  exploring row partnering for htx ; and;  will not provide pricing
until approval while hrtx must prepare to launch the product we think today
positive data could bring interest from potential acquirers
â–  valuation we are raising our risk adj sales estimates and our pt to  based
on a higher pos  from  due to today results we believe in a takeout
at  x ev s on e sales shares could be worth in the low  range
our conviction for hrtx lies in its post surgical pain opportunity
where we view htx  positive phase  data as supporting
the case that htx  has a compelling and differentiated
product profile relative to pcrx market leading exparel in
addition we believe that the htx  program is highly de risked
 pos for hrtx cinv products we think consensus
estimates may be a bit aggressive early on though our physician
checks still suggest a preference for branded cinv agents given
their favorable economics to oncology practices
base case assumption
