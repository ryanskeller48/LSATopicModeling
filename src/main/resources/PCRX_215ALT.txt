this afternoon the advisory coittee voted to not recoend approval for exparel
for nerve block to produce regional anesthesia for either a broad or a narrow label
while a negative adcom does not always lead to a drug not getting approved typically
the fda follows their lead if it is not approved on its april   pdufa we think
pcrx may need to run additional studies in order to seek approval for a broad nerve
block label but ultimately think investors will likely strip exparel nerve block sales from
their models based on discussions we've had with investors we believe consensus
sales for exparel in nerve block are around m at peak vs our sales forecast in
nerve block of m and we think shares should be deservedly down tomorrow
in response to the news despite expected weakness in shares tomorrow we remain
perform rated as we think pcrx shares could come under additional pressure when
potential competitor hrtx reports pivotal phase  data from its competing program
htx  la bupivacaine meloxicam later in h post hrtxâ€™s phase  readout
we could potentially get more constructive on pcrx shares assuming management
sets reasonable  exparel sales guidance on its q earnings calls and valuation
becomes more attractive
