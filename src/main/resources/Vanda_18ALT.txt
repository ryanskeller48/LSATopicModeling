we think vnda  sales guidance of  m consensus of m which
implies  growth at its midpoint may prove conservative  hetlioz guidance
implies mid teen volume growth as we expect hetlioz non  to benefit from both a
recent  price increase and the company hetlioz to psychiatrists initiative hpi
as we have noted before we believe the market opportunity for non  in sighted
patients is significant at the midpoint sales guidance for fanapt is basically flat
with a recent  price increase we believe if vnda can make progress stabilizing
volumes this could provide upside to numbers we believe investors will welcome
vnda  spend guidance which came in below consensus though key top line
data catalysts for tradipitant in gastroparesis and hetlioz in smith magenis syndrome
sms look as if they will be pushed to the end of  preliminary q results are in
line with consensus which we believe signals hetlioz growth is back on track overall
we view vnda update positively and reiterate our outperform rating on the stock
hetlioz q revenue of m  q q is in line with our consensus estimates
and we think this should get investors more confident the modest sequential
decline seen in q was a one time event  hetlioz sales guidance of
 m brackets our m and consensus' m estimates the guide
represents  growth at the mid point we think the guide could be
conservative depending on vnda execution of its sighted non  initiative
fanapt preliminary results for q were in line with our consensus estimates
while the  fanapt sales guide of  m is underwhelming consensus
of m; our estimate m we are not too surprised given the company
challenges in returning fanapt to volume growth since its re launch with the larger
sales force last year assuming vnda captures half of its jan   price
increase on fanapt the midpoint of guidance implies little to no volume growth
opex guidance spend guidance of  m brackets our m forecast
but came in lower than consensus' m estimate we view this as a positive
however based on the press release we don't know whether or not it accounts
for two phase  studies required for approval for tradipitant in atopic dermatitis
or just one nonetheless we think this should reassure investors the company
should remain near breakeven or regain profitability in 
pipeline we are a bit disappointed on the pipeline updates as it appears the
timing for data readouts for tradipitant in gastroparesis and hetlioz in smith
magenis appear to have been pushed out to the end of  we view both as
important catalysts for the stock we look to get more color from management on
timing for these programs in the near term or on the q eps call
