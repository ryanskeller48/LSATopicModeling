we believe the approval of apadaz benzhydrocodone apap for the short term
management of acute pain not only provides kmph a pathway for value creation
through partnering the asset but also validates its ligand activated therapy lat prodrug
platform at this point we find it difficult to assign value to apadaz not in our
model since any value hinges on kmph ability to secure a partner; however it
seems like this is a clear near term priority for the company to monetize the asset
with that said we believe the risk reward at current levels remains attractive as we
think shares should appreciate based on positive results from kp pivotal study
in adhd and potential upside from an announced apadaz partnership in the coming
months we reiterate our outperform rating
key points
apadaz label based on our discussion with management the apadaz label was
in line with its expectations and kmph highlighted several areas of differentiation
vs generic hycd apap based on data from apadaz intra nasal abuse studies
included in the drug abuse dependence section we think the approval of apadaz
should also help kmph ability to partner its other abuse deterrent pain portfolio
coercial strategy while we know kmph intends to partner apadaz
deal structure potential economics and timing all remain key unknowns as
management seeks to monetize this asset with that said from our follow up call
with kmph we get the sense discussions with partners have been ongoing for
some time and we would not be surprised if a partnership is struck in   months
market opportunity recall there are approximately m hycd apap scripts
in the us annually so the market for apadaz is large we like the fact management
is seeking a partner given specialty primary care launches in this category can be
expensive and think its strategy to price apadaz in line with generics is the only
way for the product to capture meaningful market share
what could apadaz be worth to the stock we had estimated a more
traditional partnership with a pharma partner royalties milestones could be
worth   in upside to the stock however a non traditional strategy with a
pbm could potentially be worth more if apadaz is priced in line with generics
and positioned ahead of generics via prior authorizations step edits to secure
automatic substitution at pharmacies
balance sheet we estimate kmph ended q with approximately m
which we believe is sufficient to fund the company through the readout of its pivotal
study for kp in mid  and into early  hence we think any investor
concern over a potential equity raise in the near term maybe overblown since
management is not interested in coercializing apadaz without a partner
with the company shifting its focus to its late stage assets kp
methylphenidate pro drug and kp hydrocodone pro drug
post apadaz crl we believe multiple clinical catalysts from
kmph late stage pipeline will create value over the next
  months we remain positive on kmph ligand activated
therapy lat pro drug platform and believe it has wide ranging
applicability within controlled substances for pain and other cns
therapies kmph remains well capitalized and currently has 
m in cash as of q which the company believes is
enough to fund its current clinical activities and give it runway
well into

upside scenario
clinical success for kp and kp kp in phase  studies
kmph is able to partner monetize apadaz through a partnership with
a pharma company pbm

current cash on hand is not sufficient to reach regulatory approval
