this morning vnda reported it received a paragraph iv filing regarding an anda filed
by teva for hetlioz in non  in the filing teva alleges vnda hetlioz patents '
' ' ' ' and ' all of which are methods of use patents are invalid
unenforceable or will not be infringed by teva product filed in the anda teva is
not contesting hetlioz composition of matter patent ' which runs out to dec
 and is eligible for a five year extension we don't view today news as a largely
unexpected event as our base case assumed vnda would likely receive a paragraph
iv and settle for a late  early  generic entry further as with paragraph ivs
vnda will have  days to respond to teva and the ensuing lawsuit will automatically
enact a  month stay meaning generic entry would be around may  assuming
teva were to prevail in the case however hetlioz also has orphan drug exclusivity
ode out to jan   so teva would not be able to launch before then or
  if the five year extension is granted on hetlioz ' patent as with many
of these ip litigation scenarios we think the likelihood of a settlement down the road
for a late s generic entry is high in our initiation report we had estimated if vnda
were able to prevail in the case and secure hetlioz exclusivity out to   from
our late  early base case it would be worth at least an additional  share
on our dcf we would be buyers if there is any material weakness in the stock today
though we think this event was largely expected by investors reiterate outperform
