on   trvn reported q financial results and a business update we update
our model accordingly we believe investors continue to worry about the company
existing capital overhang and the potential tone of the upcoming advisory coittee
meeting since olinvo is an iv opioid on the latter concern we think the fact
olinvo has demonstrated to be both efficacious and safe in its two phase  studies
and its  patient athena safety study it should warrant fda approval we
believe a positive adcom will serve as a near term catalyst for shares and could
help management remedy its capital needs through either an equity financing to
fund an olinvo coercial launch or through partnering the asset we maintain our
outperform rating and  price target
key points
advisory coittee we believe investor focus has turned to the upcoming
olinvo adcom which we think will likely be held in the fall of  since
the regulatory requirements for new analgesics are clear from the fda draft
guidance only need to demonstrate superiority vs pbo we think coittee
members could use this forum to discuss the current environment around opioids
and olinvo relative safety efficacy vs morphine
olinvo we believe olinvo is approvable based on its two positive pivotal apollo
studies and phase  athena safety study we think base case olinvo receives a
broad label for the treatment of moderate to severe pain where an iv opioid would
be indicated we believe olinvo enhanced safety profile and more rapid onset
relative to morphine are key differentiators that will drive adoption
coercial if olinvo is approved trvn expects to launch it in q trvn
cco intends to focus on  hospitals that have been in the past early adopters
of products like pcrx exparel and mnk ofirmev with approximately  
reps we continue to view olinvo niche will be patients who require opioid level
pain control but are at high risk of opioid related side effects
trv based on encouraging data from its phase  dose ranging study trvn
is investigating the most economical way to generate proof of concept data for
trv as a treatment for acute migraine management noted to us they may
use an experimental migraine induction model to accomplish this and while this
could prove to be de risking we currently assign no value to this program
balance sheet trvn ended  with m in cash we forecast the company
burning approximately  m per quarter in  saddling it with a capital
overhang assuming trvn fda advisory coittee is positive and olinvo
is subsequently approved we model a m equity raise in q which we
estimate will be sufficient capital for trvn to reach profitability by 
we believe trvnâ€™s lead program oliceridine for the treatment of
post surgical pain has the potential to improve upon current iv
analgesics by demonstrating a faster onset of action increased
pain reduction and fewer opioid related side effects
base case assumption
assume  probability of success for fda approval and
coercial success for olinvo iv
olinvo iv achieves peak sales of m by 
catalysts
 advisory coittee meeting for olinvo iv before pdufa
november   pdufa for olinvo iv in post surgical pain
q potential capital raise
q est olinvo launch
upside scenario
olinvo iv is approved and pos moves to   share upside
olinvo iv exceeds our peak sales estimate of m by 
downside scenario
olinvo iv does not gain fda approval
olinvo does not meet our m peak sales estimate
