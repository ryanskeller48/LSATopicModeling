we think management  exparel sales guidance of  m which implies
 year over year growth seems achievable as the jnj collaboration continues to
make strides and pcrx continues to secure partnerships with health systems both
of which should accelerate growth in  with that said we are still not ready to
step into shares as we believe they could be weak on positive results from hrtx
two phase  studies for its competing program htx  top line expected in h
and adjust our model accordingly however we think the stock is already pricing in a
complete response letter for exparel in nerve block based on its negative panel and
post the htx  data we could get more constructive on shares assuming valuation
is attractive for now we remain on the sidelines
key points
guidance management has had challenges achieving its exparel sales guidance
for the past several years so we think investors will welcome the conservatism in
the counicated  guidance we believe pcrx coercial initiatives and
in particular its potential to secure a j code for exparel could be a meaningful
positive swing factor for out year exparel consensus estimates
nerve block indication given the negative adcom meeting earlier this month
and the subsequent stock reaction we think its safe to say investors are
forecasting a low probability of approval pdufa is april   for exparel in
nerve block with that said the company maintains a dialogue with the agency
regarding exparel potential for this indication
thoughts on recent generic draft guidance earlier this month the fda
published draft guidance for the development of a generic liposomal bupivacaine
and for the most part we agree with pcrx view it is technically challenging to
develop a generic exparel though you cannot totally rule it out however we think
other branded players such as hrtx polypid and taiwan liposome co could
represent future branded competition to the exparel franchise
clinical studies pcrx continues to build out its data set for soft tissue
procedures and believes positive data from its c section and breast reconstruction
studies could help drive exparel utilization for these soft tissue surgeries
physicians we have spoken with are quite enthusiastic about exparel potential
in c section and await the study results which are expected later this year
business development pcrx remains active on this initiative and with m
in cash it has the firepower to bring in additional coercial assets to help
diversify its revenue streams drugs or devices sold into the hospital channel or
ascs make the most sense in our view
while we are generally positive on exparel’s demonstrated ability
to provide  long acting analgesia in the post operative setting;
 reduce overall opioid consumption and;  reduce patients’
length of stay we believe consensus exparel estimates are
too high as street estimates may be overly optimistic due to
the recent jnj pcrx partnership for exparel for orthopedic
procedures and believe the street is not adequately factoring in
competition at current levels we believe shares offer a balanced
risk reward and await further clarity on exparel’s near term
growth drivers along with updates from competitive programs
before getting more constructive
base case assumption
exparel generics are not introduced prior to 
exparel receives approval for nerve block
jnj promotional efforts for exparel in orthopedic procedures leads
to meaningful future growth
competitor hrtx programs are approved though pcrx is able to
maintain majority share due to first mover advantage
catalysts
 jnj promotion efforts for exparel in orthopedic procedures
 potential business development activity
april   pdufa for exparel in nerve block
h top line data from pivotal studies from competitors hrtx
mid  cms draft on  proposals may address exparel jcode unbundling
upside scenario
no exparel generics +
pcrx partners exparel outside the us
pcrx acquires additional accretive assets complimentary to exparel
jnj promotional efforts for exparel in orthopedic procedures only
leads to greater than expected incremental growth
competitor hrtx programs fail in late stage clinical trials or fail to
gain approval
downside scenario
exparel generics are introduced prior to 
exparel does not gain approval in nerve block
pcrx overpays for a coercial asset
jnj promotional efforts for exparel in orthopedic procedures only
leads to modest incremental growth
competitor hrtx programs are approved and offer an
improvement over exparel on duration of benefit and length of stay
