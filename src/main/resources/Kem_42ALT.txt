on   kmph reported q financial results and provided a business update
we adjust our model accordingly we continue to like the stock though we recognize
the company capital overhang existing cash is expected to last into q given
management increase in forecasted opex due to spending associated with apadaz
supply agreements accelerated r&d investments in  with that said we believe
there are multiple value creating catalysts for the stock which could result in nondilutive
financing including  pivotal study data from kp methylphenidate
prodrug for adhd in mid ;  announcement of a coercial partnership for
apadaz by the end of ; and  potential partnering for kmph additional pain
prodrug candidates we'd be buying on today weakness
key points
kp data from kp iv human abuse liability hal study is expected in
q while intranasal oral are expected in the h as we near top line data
from its pivotal study mid  we continue to model a  pos given 
kp is methylphenidate which we know is efficacious in adhd patients; and 
pk pd data suggesting early onset longer duration than current methylphenidate
products assuming data are positive kmph should be in position to file anda
in early 
kp as noted previously kmph intends to leverage data from its kp
development program for kp a super extended release methylphenidate
prodrug this should expedite its clinical development path reduce overall
development costs and the company expects to file anda by late  we think
kp could find a place as an alternative option to shpg mydayis which is a
long acting amphetamine
apadaz we believe kmph ability to monetize apadaz hinges on a partnership
with a pbm or generic company we think a deal which management believes it
could announce by year end will be  a source of non dilutive capital to fund
additional r&d efforts and  validation of this coercial partnership model
which kmph could roll out with its additional pain portfolio candidates recall
kmph has five other opioid prodrug candidates in development
balance sheet kmph ended  with m in cash and management expects
quarterly cash burn to be in the  m range in  we expect existing cash
to give the company runway into  similar to management guidance but
our model does assume an equity raise post kp pivotal data management
indicated it has m remaining on its atm which it can use to fund operations;
however as we noted we see several avenues for kmph to secure non dilutive
financing in 
despite the company capital overhang we believe there are
multiple value creating catalysts for kmph over the next  
months which could result in non dilutive financing including
 pivotal study data from kp methylphenidate prodrug
for adhd in mid ;  announcement of a coercial
partnership for apadaz by the end of ; and  potential
partnering for kmph additional pain prodrug candidates
furthermore we continue to remain positive on kmph ligand
activated therapy lat pro drug platform and believe it has wideranging
applicability within controlled substances for pain and
other cns therapies
