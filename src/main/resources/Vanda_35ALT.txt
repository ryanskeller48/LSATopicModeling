this morning vnda announced positive results from its phase  jet study
evaluating hetlioz for the treatment of jet lag disorder while we think there are still
some open questions on the coercial viability market opportunity for hetlioz in this
indication we expect investors to view the headline positively and we believe this
provides additional data on hetlioz potential in treating patients with circadian rhythm
disorders outside of non  with that said we await further detail on vnda snda
submission timing for hetlioz in jet lag disorder and specifics on its coercial plan
before including in our model we continue to like the stock set up in the near term
as we expect hetlioz sales acceleration along with potential upside from key clinical
catalysts later this year we reiterate our outperform rating and  pt
key points
phase  jet lag data hetlioz demonstrated a stat sig benefit vs placebo on the
total sleep time tst   of night the primary endpoint p improving
tst by  minutes vs placebo and total sleep time full night by  minutes
p vs placebo further secondary endpoints on next day alertness on
both vas and kass scales were all stat sig
jet study design the design of the jet study was similar to vnda previous
jet study which simulated a circadian challenge however the initial study
design which vnda had discussed with the fda was for patients to actually travel
 hours given the confounding factors of sleep deprivation light conditions vnda
chose to change the design which we believe could present some approval risk
coercial strategy for jet lag management did not provide specifics on its
coercial strategy but believes targeting the m business class first class
us travelers to destinations   hours represents the target market recall we
estimate the cost of treatment in jet lag at  for  days so we are a
bit cautious on payer patient attitudes toward the cost benefit for hetlioz in this
indication
what could jet lag worth every  market penetration k patients at a
treatment cost of  would yield m in sales we think s&m spend is
likely to be modest since it would only be needed at targeted airports in the us and
it is unlikely vnda would need additional reps we estimate m in additional
sales each year between   could be worth about  share
next up we continue to like the set up for the stock over the next   months
we believe accelerating hetlioz sales in non  due to the hetlioz to psychiatry
initiative hpi in sighted non  patients along with clinical catalysts for tradipitant
in gastroparesis q and hetlioz in smith magenis syndrome q are all
near term value creation events
we believe vanda pharmaceuticals offers investors a growing
base business with hetlioz non  and fanapt schizophrenia
along with significant pipeline optionality we expect vnda
to report data from what we believe are two relatively derisked
clinical studies in the next  months investors may
be overlooking vnda clinical programs as we believe
today valuation reflects only the company coercial assets
for its base business  guidance looks achievable and
management re launch strategy for fanapt could yield modest
growth for the franchise
