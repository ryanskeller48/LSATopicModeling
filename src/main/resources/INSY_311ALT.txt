on   insy reported q financial results and provided a business update we
update our model accordingly we remain cautious on insy shares as there have
been no clear signs of stabilization for subsys nor are we confident this will occur
in the near term further we believe any doj settlement may require insy to raise
additional capital given declines in its base business and current level of operating
spend while some investors are excited around insy cannabidiol cbd and spray
pipeline programs we prefer to be on the sidelines until we get more clarity on a
settlement capital needs de risking data from its cbd pipeline and a more material
improvement in the company base business before getting more constructive on the
stock we maintain our perform rating
key points
subsys we don't expect subsys stabilization in the near term as we think
physicians remain cautious on prescribing subsys given its negative publicity and
availability of other treatment options further pull through from recent managed
care wins likely won't have a material impact until q we forecast  subsys
sales declining  y y which assumes sales could start to stabilize in the h
tirf market trends the tirf market continues to experience meaningful
declines and is down  y y year to date according to symphony script data
with real no signs of stabilization for this class we believe this remains a key
variable to whether subsys can stabilize grow in  as any positive share gains
from improved market access will be offset by an overall contracting market
syndros we don't find it surprising syndros' launch is getting off to a slow start
q sales were k and management noted in our follow up call 
of scripts are being rejected by payers we don't think this is unusual given the
product is much more expensive and modestly differentiated relative to g marinol
and we still think   consensus estimates are likely high
pipeline management remains enthusiastic about its cbd and spray pipeline
programs while we think its buprenorphine pdufa july   and
epinephrine pharmacokinetic data in q spray programs offer near term
catalysts for shares investor interest is largely focused on insy cbd platform
at this point we await additional de risking data from its cbd programs before
incorporating in our model
balance sheet insy ended  with m in cash we estimate  cash
burn of m which excludes any potential payments associated with a doj
settlement we maintain our view insy may require additional capital even if its
minimum liability is m with a five year payment term though based on our
previous diligence we think a settlement could be in the  m range
we rate shares of insy perform we remain on the sidelines
as we believe the current valuation offers a balanced risk reward
given the uncertainty around the ongoing doj investigation
subsys growth prospects and the upcoming syndros launch we
believe these factors are balanced by insy’s attractive pipeline
which one could argue investors are getting for free at today’s
valuation while this may be the case we prefer to stay on the
sidelines until we get more clarity on the outcome of the doj
investigation and subsys growth prospects before stepping in
base case assumption
subsys volume declines persist in early  and begin to stabilize
in late 
subsys long term growth in the low single digits driven by indication

syndros achieves peak sales of m
buprenorphine spray launches in 
no credit for cbd epinephrine or naloxone pipeline programs

upside scenario
subsys volumes decline less than our base case and return to
volume growth
subsys reimbursement improves more quickly than we forecast
syndros achieves peak sales more in line with mgmt estimates of
m
buprenorphine spray launch ramps faster than consensus estimates
insy generates meaningfully de risking data from its cbd platform
epinephrine and naloxone programs are approved
downside scenario
subsys volumes continue to face headwinds and experience greater
volume declines than we consensus forecast
syndros sales are lower than our consensus forecasts
buprenorphine spray is not approved
doj settlement is greater m minimum liability
payment terms for a settlement require insy to raise capital
