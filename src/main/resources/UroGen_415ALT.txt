as the gentle rock band creed put it in one of their  hits can you take me higher we think urgn can and will; hence we are raising our pt to  from  based on mitogel’s impressive interim results from its olympus study in upper tract urothelial carcinoma utuc as we noted before the complete response rate cr came in better than seen in the compassionate use study  vs  and assuming similar trends in the remaining patients in the study we see it mathematically difficult for mitogel to not demonstrate a cr rate of   in the olympus study given that we increase our pos to  from  as the biggest open question remains mitogel’s durability of cr in utuc which will be borne out in the coming months key points interim results as we highlighted in our previous note the data was solid since urgn plans to enroll a total of about  patients in the olympus study per clinicaltrialsgov mathematically it is becoming hard for mitogel to not achieve the   hurdle cr rate which the fda and kols view as clinically meaningful since   patients have achieved a cr so far urgn really only needs   more complete responders to be successful on its primary endpoint safety in our follow up with management it noted the adverse events aes reported in the interim results are consistent with aes seen from mitomycin c as we highlighted before we think given the high unmet need in the utuc population mitogel safety profile looks good so far but we await the full data set aua presentation urgn will present the olympus interim data at the american urological association meeting may    the company will also provide whatever additional data it may have which could include further data on  month durability along with  month data from several patients while there is no bar for durability we think  months would be a win so continued positive trends at the   and  month time points remain important regulatory while it hard to speculate given the compelling interim data we think it creates a strong case for urgn to potentially bring the olympus interim data now or when slightly more patients have reached the pde to the fda even before the full data reads out whether urgn chooses to do this or not we don't know but if the cr rate remains  we think it remains a possibility and could expedite mitogel development regulatory process valuation we are raising our pt to  as we are increasing our probability of success pos to  for mitogel in utuc we are confident mitogel will hit a cr rate of   or higher although its durability remains an open question; therefore we do not de risk the program more than we already have at this time
we believe urgn’s proprietary rtgel platform may allow for improved drug delivery and efficacy in various types of urothelial cancers given its ability to be delivered in hard to treat areas within the urinary tract without interfering with the natural flow of fluids from the urinary tract and bladder we view the platform as somewhat de risked given encouraging data from urgn’s early studies for both mitogel and vesigel in their respective indications and believe they could represent a paradigm shift in the treatment of uro oncology indications if approved
