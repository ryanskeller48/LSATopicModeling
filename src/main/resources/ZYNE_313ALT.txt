on   zyne announced q financial results and provided a business update
we update our model accordingly we see a relatively balanced risk reward for the
shares over the next   months as the company continues to progress its pipeline
through the initiation of multiple clinical studies over the course of  with results
mostly expected in + we expect incremental data from zyn fab c study
in fragile x syndrome fxs and star   studies in refractory focal epilepsy to
be presented at several medical meetings in  however we do not view these
as stock moving catalysts while management continues to execute well on clinical
development initiatives we remain on the sidelines due to the lack of meaningful nearterm
catalysts
key points
fxs we believe the clarity gained from zyne recent fda meeting for its
fxs clinical program helps de risk zyn development pathway a bit as the
company and the agency are now both on the same page regarding pivotal trial
design endpoints zyne expects to initiate the study by mid  which we think
sets up a data readout in the mid to late  time frame
epilepsy zyne plans to initiate another phase b for zyn for patients with
refractory focal epilepsy management had previously highlighted key learnings
from the star   studies but also noted in the press release that it will test a
higher dose which we learned from ir will be mg qd to better understand
zyn maximum tolerated dose recall instar the high dose mg was
actually less efficacious than the low mg
dee program management remains enthusiastic about zyn potential
as a treatment for a category of disorders called developmental epileptic
encephalopathies dee which affects k patients in the us it intends to
initiate a small n= open label phase  study to help determine which specific
indications to later bring into pbo controlled studies data are expected in 
zyn data from zyn transdermal thc patch phase  first in human
study are expected in h following the results zyne plans to initiate a phase
 study in tourette syndrome while we find this program interesting we await
further clinical data and at this time do not include it in our model
balance sheet zyne ended  with m in cash we estimate cash burn
of approximately m in  and believe current cash gives it runway to
mid  the company also has an atm in place with approximately m
remaining which zyne can also use to fund operations to reach key clinical
milestones later in 
zyne is a clinical stage specialty pharmaceutical company
focused on developing and coercializing synthetic
cannabinoid therapeutics in a transdermal formulation we
believe zyn the company lead product candidate
may offer a differentiated cannibidiol cbd treatment option
for patients with epilepsy fragile x syndrome and other
neuropsychiatric disorders
base case assumption
zyn has a  probability of clinical and coercial success in
fragile x syndrome
no value attributed to zyn in epilepsy
no value attributed to zyn in dee
no value attributed to zyn program
catalysts
 phase  open label results for zyn in developmental and
epileptic encephalopathies dee
mid to late  pivotal study results from zyn in fragile x
syndrome
upside scenario
inclusion of zyn program in our valuation
inclusion of zyn in epilepsy and or dee in our valuation
downside scenario
no path forward for zyn in fragile x syndrome
need for dilutive financing
