this morning prgo announced it will re schedule its q earnings release and
conference call as it needs additional time to complete its final income tax review
procedures related to reconciliations of specific non cash items with that said
preliminary top line and adjusted operating income results reported today are pretty
much in line with street estimates based on the press release it is unclear how long
it will take prgo to finish its review or what the outcome could yield though we think
the shares could be weak today given the uncertainty of the news and potential impact
on  forecasts as we noted in our earnings preview we like the stock setup for
prgo in  ie chci turnaround  rx pharma consensus estimates look low
and potential for bolt on m&a share repurchase so if the news this morning causes
significant weakness in prgo shares it could serve as a good buying opportunity
for investors
