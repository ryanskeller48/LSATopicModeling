we are updating our model to reflect q financial results and management 
revenue guidance hrtx upcoming data readout for htx  remains its most
important catalyst and we believe on positive data shares could reach the low  
share range we forecast a  probability of success pos htx  will hit stat
sig on its primary and three key secondary endpoints we believe if the study fails or
if htx  does not demonstrate superior efficacy vs g bupivacaine with the latter
scenario making htx  more of a me too product relative to pcrx exparel
the shares could fall to the low to mid teens reflecting value only for hrtx cinv
business given the recent pullback in shares we think the risk reward still looks
favorable at these levels
key points
guidance management reiterated its january   sales guidance of
 m for its cinv franchise we forecast sales of m and believe
newly launched cinvanti will be a modest contributor in  we continue to
think meaningful sustol adoption will only occur post a g aloxi approval and
reimbursement arbitrage which will incentivize physicians to use g aloxi for two
quarters or so
htx  the upcoming readouts for its two pivotal studies remains the key value
driver for the stock while htx  must demonstrate a stat sig benefit vs pbo to
gain approval for the stock to work and have a differentiated profile from pcrx
exparel htx  must demonstrate superiority over g bupivacaine we remain
confident it will do just that based on its positive phase  data phase  study
design and increased study powering
htx  opioid sparing endpoints we'd point out to investors study patients
will first rescue with tylenol if appropriate for breakthrough pain in the phase 
studies before taking an opioid similar to the hernia phase  where hrtx saw
 opioid free patients vs  for g bupivacaine this plus the endpoints
are  powered to show superiority vs g bupivacaine gives us confidence
htx  could hit on these important secondary endpoints
cash the company remains well financed with m in cash on its balance
sheet we don't expect a capital raise subsequent to the htx  top line data
given hrtx recent financing which should be sufficient to launch htx  if
approved we forecast lower quarterly burn through  to about  m 
quarter in h since htx  clinical studies wrap up in h
valuation our  price target is based on a discounted cash flow analysis
between   using a  wacc and no terminal value our base case
assigns   and  for htx  sustol and cinvanti respectively
we believe recent weakness in shares offers investors an
attractive entry point ahead of two meaningful catalysts cinvanti
cinv launch and top line data for htx  pivotal studies in
h our conviction for hrtx lies in its post pain opportunity
where we view htx  phase  data supporting a compelling
and differentiated product profile relative to pcrx marketleading
exparel for hrtx cinv products we think consensus
estimates may be a bit aggressive early on though our physician
checks still suggest a preference for branded cinv agents given
their favorable economics to oncology practices
base case assumption
htx   probability of phase  and coercial success;
assume  launch and un risk adjusted peak sales of m by
e
sustol reaches m in peak sales by e and we currently
do not factor in a life cycle extension in our base case
cinvanti assume approval in nov  and peak sales of m
by e
assume a m equity raise in  after positive data for
htx  pivotal studies in post operative pain
catalysts
h est top line data for htx  pivotal studies for post operative
pain in bunion and hernia surgeries
 est launch of generic aloxi by teva
 nda filing for htx  in post operative pain
 est approval for htx  in post operative pain
upside scenario
htx   probability of phase  and coercial success;
assume  launch and un risk adjusted peak sales of m by
e
sustol reaches m in peak sales by e and assuming
hrtx launches a life cycle extension durable to e
cinvanti assume approval in nov  and peak sales of m
by e
hrtx is acquired
downside scenario
htx   probability of phase  and coercial success;
assume  launch and un risk adjusted peak sales of m by
e
sustol reaches m in peak sales by e and we currently
do not factor in a life cycle extension in our base case
cinvanti assume approval in nov  and peak sales of m
by e
hrtx requires additional capital beyond what we have forecasted
