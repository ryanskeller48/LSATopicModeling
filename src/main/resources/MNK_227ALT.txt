with shares up  vs s&p  is flat after this morning earnings release 
guidance we would not be buying into the rally we believe the stock move is being
mostly driven by short covering rather than fundamental buying and since there are
many moving parts to management guidance re casted financials to be provided
ahead of q eps with generics now in disc ops and view  as a transition year
for the company as it looks to divest its generics business in the near term while mnk
has a few interesting clinical catalysts in  we think headline risk from additional
corticotropin competitors its increasing r&d cost base high leverage and potential
generic competition to its inomax franchise all remain headwinds for the stock
key points
acthar management expects acthar to decline in  though still expects
the brand to generate b in sales we think consensus estimate implies flat
growth will need to come down moderately absent on the call was any reference
to mnk long term growth target mid single digit to low double digit so we
wonder if management could potentially walk back this growth target in the future
acthar payer issues the company continues to work through the payer
pushback script abandonment issues and is focused on its enhanced payer reengagement
strategy to ensure access for refractory patients who are best suited
to benefit from acthar with that said it unclear to us how this is any different
from its prior payer strategy or when this could reaccelerate the brand growth
generics post the scmp deal its seems logical for mnk to divest its generics
business since amitiza will provide it with a semi durable source of cash flow
through  it hard to say when an acquirer could materialize for its generics
business and what value mnk could achieve proceeds from any transaction
should be used for the repayment of debt in our view
pipeline there are a collection of near term clinical catalysts for the company
including  stannsoporfin hyperbilirubinemia adcom this spring and pdufa
on august  ;  amitiza pdufa for pediatric constipation on april 
; and  pivotal data for vts  niemann pick type c in mid 
however we don't expect sales from mnk pipeline to become a significant
contributor until the   timeframe
valuation based on our revised ebitda estimate of b which includes
contribution from the scmp acquisition and removal of the sales expense
contribution from mnk generics business using the company guidance mnk
trades at  x ev ebitda at this point we don't see a need to assign a higher
multiple given the low visibility on acthar reacceleration headline risk and potential
competitive threats
our prior thesis of branded growth and material margin
expansion has not and is unlikely to play out within the
next   months with little to no visibility on acthar growth
outside of management remarks on the payer pushback patient
abandonment issues it hard for us to be constructive on
the shares we are not certain whether mnk can remedy the
acthar growth issue in a timely manner and this occurs as the
company r&d cost base continues to increase due to recent
pipeline investments and amidst the divestment of it generics
business
base case assumption
acthar returns to growth in the h
inomax begins to see competition in +
therakos growth in the high single digits
mnk successfully sells its generics business
catalysts
 update from anip on competitive corticotropin program
april   amitiza pdufa for pediatric constipation
spring  stannsoporfin adcom
mid  vts  pivotal data for niemann pick type c
august   stannsoporfin pdufa for hyperbilirubinemia
oct  fda exclusivity for inomax ends
late  or  inomax appeal decision
upside scenario
acthar growth outpaces consensus forecasts
no competition to acthar or inomax franchises
accretive bolt on m&a
generics business sells for a higher multiple than expected
pipeline candidates become further de risked and drive organic
growth in out years
downside scenario
more significant competition to acthar from novel therapeutics and 
or other branded corticotropins than we forecast
inomax and therakos underperform consensus estimates in the out
years
mnk becomes overleveraged due to m&a
generics business sells for a lower multiple than expected or mnk
is unable to successfully sell the business
