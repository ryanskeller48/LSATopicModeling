this morning abstracts for the american urological association aua meeting in
may were posted in the journal of urology including the interim results of urgn
olympus study for mitogel as a treatment for low grade upper tract urothelial
carcinoma utuc the interim results from olympus show that in the intent to treat
itt population n= patients mitogel achieved a complete response cr rate
of    patients had a cr based on our discussion with urologists we had
previously noted the bar was low for mitogel in utuc and a cr  would be a
win given the standard of care soc remains surgery which could include removal
of the upper tract and kidney recall mitogel had demonstrated a  cr rate in its
compassionate use study we think today data is impressive and further supports
mitogel potential as a first line non invasive therapy used ahead of surgery for
patients with utuc as we previously noted we believed if the interim data and the
subsequent full top line data from the olympus study were to be positive shares
could reach the low  range we reiterate outperform rating
olympus according to the abstract  total patients with utuc have been
treated so far but only  have undergone primary disease evaluation pde
assessments ie n= for the itt population while  are pending pde 
of patients enrolled had tumors located in regions not amenable for surgical
resection recall urgn plans to enroll a total of  patients for the entire study
and full top line data is expected in q on the question of duration so far 
patients have undergone  month follow up and remain in cr
safety mitogel seems to have been well tolerated thus far in the study with
treatment emergent aes including utis flank pain and transient creatinine
elevation with most aes reported to be mild or moderate in nature given the high
unmet need in this population we think the emerging safety profile for mitogel
seems good but we await the full data set
